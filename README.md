# SJFG
Shitty Jojo Fighting Game

# About
SJFG is an open source jojo fighting game made to replace things like UFE and things of the sort. To import characters you will have to use .JFIGHTER files and add them to the FIGHTERS folder. Characters must have proporly allocated stat points or they will not be loaded.

# How it works
SJFG is very easy to use, all you have to do is have at least one .JFIGHTER in your FIGHTERS folder and at least one .JSTAGE file in your stage folder. After this the game will boot and you will be able to select your fighters and stages in the menu. Online play has not yet been built but is in the works.

# Other info
